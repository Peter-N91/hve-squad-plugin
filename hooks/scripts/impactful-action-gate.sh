# Source: squad-autopilot.instructions.md (Impactful-Action Gate), squad-watch-mode.instructions.md
# (the absolute unattended variant). See ../README.md for exact scope and limitations.
#
# Decision is 'ask', not 'deny': the gate is documented as stop -> human approval -> proceed, and
# only 'ask' can complete that third step. Interactive CLI prompts the human; cloud agent and other
# non-interactive surfaces convert 'ask' to 'deny' automatically, which is the Watch Mode absolute
# variant. Keep this pattern identical to impactful-action-gate.ps1 — a rule present in only one of
# the two denies on Windows and allows on Linux for the same command.
